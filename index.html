        <h1>Self-driving Car Simulator</h1>
        <p>
            This simulator showcases a self-driving car navigating through traffic using a custom-built, three-layer neural network.
            The car is equipped with sensors that detect nearby vehicles and obstacles. The neural network processes this sensory data
            to make real-time decisions, allowing the car to steer, accelerate, or brake as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the right, you can see a visual representation of the neural network. The network is divided into three layers, 
            each processing different aspects of the input data to determine the car's next move. This visualizer helps in understanding 
            how the inputs from the car's sensors influence its decisions at each level of the network.
        </p>
        <p>
            The simulator also incorporates a genetic algorithm with a variable mutation rate, allowing you to evolve the car's behavior over time.
            The best-performing car in each generation is saved, and you can use the <strong>💾 Save</strong> button to store its performance manually.
            The saved data is crucial for comparing the effectiveness of different generations and tweaking the neural network or mutation rates.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to delete the last saved performance, simply use the <strong>🗑️ Delete</strong> button. This feature is particularly useful 
            when you want to reset progress or start fresh with new parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both the mutation rate and other genetic algorithm parameters can be adjusted in the source code, giving you full control over the evolution 
            of the car's driving capabilities.
