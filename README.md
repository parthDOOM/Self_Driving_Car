I've been working on this project as a way to learn the basics of Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms. It's coded entirely in JavaScript and HTML and uses no pre-existing libraries.

This project is a simulated environment where AI-powered cars learn to drive by themselves. You can run this project on your own computer, or check out the live project here:

You can also adjust some settings from main.js, like the number of cars and the mutationRate. I suggest that you start the mutation rate at 0.3 and periodically decrease it to improve the performance of all the cars.
